            <p> In the small town of Maplewood, where the loudest sound is usually the church bell or the occasional rooster, a surprising new duo has become the talk of the town: 10-year-old Ellie Marsh and her 120-pound pet pig, Sir Oinks-a-Lot.<br>Ellie, a fifth-grader with a love for animals and a flair for drama, adopted Sir Oinks-a-Lot from a local rescue shelter six months ago. What began as a “temporary foster situation” quickly turned into a lifelong friendship—and a viral sensation.<br>“I thought pigs just rolled in mud and ate everything,” Ellie told Maplewood News while feeding Sir Oinks-a-Lot a banana from her lunchbox. “But he’s super smart! He knows how to sit, spin, and even play the piano... sort of.”<br>“I thought pigs just rolled in mud and ate everything,” Ellie told Maplewood News while feeding Sir Oinks-a-Lot a banana from her lunchbox. “But he’s super smart! He knows how to sit, spin, and even play the piano... sort of.”<br>Since then, Ellie and Sir Oinks-a-Lot have made appearances at birthday parties, local fairs, and even the town council meeting—where the pig briefly interrupted a zoning discussion by snatching the mayor’s sandwich.<br>He has opinions,” Ellie said with a giggle.<br>Locals say the duo brings a dose of joy wherever they go. “I’ve lived here 70 years,” said Bob Jenkins, owner of Maplewood Hardware. “Never seen anything like that pig riding in a wagon wearing sunglasses.”<br>Ellie has big plans for her porcine pal. This fall, she hopes to enter Sir Oinks-a-Lot in the Junior Animal Talent Show at the state fair. “He’s working on a new trick where he bows after each song,” she said. “We’re calling it ‘The Grand Oink Finale.’”<br>As for the pig himself? Sir Oinks-a-Lot seems content to trot beside Ellie, enjoy belly rubs, and snack on apples.“He’s my best friend,” Ellie said. “And he gives the best snorts.”<br>Her Connection with the pig remains Unbreakable. It's something diiferent which other animals could not find or sort out.<br>But only complain and gossip behind their back. Yet they stayed together and made sure the both are okay and happy. The girl felt very blessed to have her pannikutty<br> Behind all the humans and animals "Her Pannikutty" choosed her and stayed by her side as always & forever!:) She hoped that it would never end</p>

<p>MUTHAYAMMAL ENGINEERING COLLEGE — For 36 unforgettable days, the Full Stack Java Training Programme, led by the ever-charismatic Mr. Krushnaraj, has been equal parts education, entertainment, and unexpected cardio exercise.<br>From day one, students knew this wasn’t going to be an ordinary training. Mr. Krushnaraj’s teaching style is a perfect mix of clear explanations, practical coding sessions, and sudden ear-splitting shouts that jolt students awake faster than triple-shot espresso. “He’ll be explaining loops so sweetly one second… and the next second, he’s screaming like the compiler threw an error in real life,” chuckles Luna, a participant in the programme.<br>The trainer’s friendly approach makes even complex Java concepts easy to understand. But just when students feel too comfortable, they are hit with his signature “horrible shout,” which has been scientifically proven (by the students) to increase reaction speed by 200%.<br>Known for his friendly nature and crystal-clear explanations, Mr. Krushnaraj has mastered the art of keeping students engaged — right until the moment he suddenly shouts horribly mid-lecture, causing keyboards to rattle and hearts to skip a beat. “It’s like learning code and testing our reflexes at the same time,” laughs Luna, one of the attendees.<br>The class also features coding games, where winners earn chocolates — a currency more valuable than Bitcoin in the student economy. “It’s intense,” says Naveen, another participant. “You’re not just typing Java, you’re typing for survival… and snacks.”<br>Between debugging sessions, sudden jump-scare shouts, and competitive chocolate battles, the atmosphere remains electric. Students agree that these 36 days are not just about becoming full stack developers — they’re about creating memories, laughing through mistakes, and maybe, just maybe, learning to keep their heart rate steady during lectures.<br>Between serious coding marathons, sudden jump-scares, and bursts of laughter, the programme has become more than a skill-building course. It’s a place where friendships are strengthened, confidence is built, and every day brings a new inside joke.<br>Luna and Naveen, inseparable members of the class, have turned the training into their personal adventure. “We’ve had fun, learned a lot, and screamed a few times… but in the end, this was the most entertaining 36 days of our college life,” they agree.<br>The Student Gazette hereby declares the Full Stack Java Training Programme as the Most Entertaining Educational Experience of the Semester. </p>

<h2>Coding Joins Olympics, Lishmiya Strikes Gold!</h2>
<h3>Headline: New Sports Alert</h3>

<p>In an unprecedented move, the International Olympic Committee announced that “Competitive Coding” is now an official Olympic sport — and guess who dominated? Yes, none other than our hometown hero Lishmiya, who, as usual, didn’t just win… she made it look like a warm-up session.<br>In what experts are calling “the nerdiest sprint in history”, the International Olympic Committee shocked the world by introducing Competitive Coding as an official Olympic sport this year. And, in a result that surprised absolutely no one, Lishmiya swooped in and claimed gold — with her trademark style of winning as if it’s just another Tuesday.<br>Lishmiya not only aced every task but also refactored the competition’s scoreboard for “better efficiency” while the match was still going on. Rumor has it, she submitted her code so fast that the compiler asked her to “please slow down.”<br>The event featured intense challenges like “Debug 1000 Errors in 5 Minutes” and “Write Hello World in 37 Programming Languages While Eating a Sandwich.” Lishmiya breezed through every round, even helping her competitors fix their bugs mid-match, just for fun.<br>The crowd roared when the scoreboard showed a perfect score of 1000/1000 — achieved in record-breaking time. According to eyewitnesses, Lishmiya even stopped midway to sip tea and casually explain recursion to the confused referees.<br>The crowd erupted in laughter when, during a high-pressure debugging round, Lishmiya found a bug in the judge’s code and fixed it, earning bonus points that didn’t even exist before.<br>When asked about her victory, she humbly said, “I just pressed Ctrl+Z on my competitors."“Thanks to my parents, my laptop, and Stack Overflow for moral support.”<br>The gold medal ceremony was equally hilarious — instead of the national anthem, the stadium speakers accidentally played a Windows XP startup sound, and Lishmiya stood proudly with her gold medal, holding a laptop instead of a bouquet.<br>Next year, the committee is considering adding “Competitive Bug Creation” to the event, but sources say Lishmiya might win that too… just by thinking about it.<br>Insiders say she is already being eyed for endorsements by major tech companies, and one cereal brand is launching “Lishmiya Loops – the breakfast of coding champions.”</p>
